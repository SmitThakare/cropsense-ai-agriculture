    'NHigh': """The nitrogen value of soil is high and might give rise to weeds. 
    <br/>Please consider the following suggestions:
    <br/><br/> • <i> Manure </i> – adding manure is one of the simplest ways to amend your soil with nitrogen. Be careful as there are various types of manures with varying degrees of nitrogen.
    <br/><br/> • <i>Coffee grinds </i> – use your morning addiction to feed your gardening habit! Coffee grinds are considered a green compost material which is rich in nitrogen. Once the grounds break down, your soil will be fed with delicious, delicious nitrogen.
    <br/><br/> • <i>Plant nitrogen fixing plants</i> – planting vegetables that are nitrogen fixing can also increase the nitrogen in your soil.
    <br/><br/> • <i>Plant 'green manure' crops</i> – planting crops that are slow releasing nitrogen sources can also increase the nitrogen in your soil.
    """,

    'Nlow': """The nitrogen value of your soil is low.
    <br/>Please consider the following suggestions:
    <br/><br/> • <i>Add sawdust or wood shavings to your soil</i> – the carbon in sawdust/wood shavings will help absorb and soak up and excess nitrogen.
    <br/><br/> • <i>Plant heavy nitrogen feeding plants</i> – tomatoes, corn, broccoli, cabbage and spinach are examples of plants that thrive off nitrogen and will suck the nitrogen dry.
    <br/><br/> • <i>Water your soil</i> – soaking your soil with water will help leach the nitrogen deeper into your soil, effectively leaving less for your plants to use.
    <br/><br/> • <i>Mulch heavily</i> – a heavy mulch on top of your soil will also leach nitrogen from your soil as it breaks down.
    """,

    'PHigh': """The phosphorus value of your soil is high.
    <br/>Please consider the following suggestions:
    <br/><br/> • <i>Reduce phosphorus fertilizers</i> – avoid adding any fertilizers that contain phosphorus for the time being.
    <br/><br/> • <i>Plant phosphorus loving plants</i> – root vegetables like carrots, beets, turnips and potatoes will use up excess phosphorus.
    <br/><br/> • <i>Use organic matter</i> – organic matter will slowly release nutrients and help balance your soil chemistry.
    <br/><br/> • <i>Consider soil testing</i> – regular soil testing can help you monitor nutrient levels.
    """,

    'Plow': """The phosphorus value of your soil is low.
    <br/>Please consider the following suggestions:
    <br/><br/> • <i>Bone meal</i> – bone meal is a great organic source of phosphorus.
    <br/><br/> • <i>Rock phosphate</i> – rock phosphate is a natural mineral source of phosphorus.
    <br/><br/> • <i>Phosphorus fertilizers</i> – use fertilizers high in phosphorus content.
    <br/><br/> • <i>Organic compost</i> – well-aged compost can provide slow-release phosphorus.

    'KHigh': """The potassium value of your soil is high.
    <br/>Please consider the following suggestions:
    <br/><br/> • <i>Loosen the soil</i> – adding organic matter to loosen the soil will help wash away excess potassium.
    <br/><br/> • <i>Water your soil</i> – soaking your soil will help leach excess potassium deeper into the soil.
    <br/><br/> • <i>Stop adding potassium fertilizers</i> – avoid any fertilizers containing potassium for now.
    <br/><br/> • <i>Add calcium and magnesium</i> – these nutrients can help balance high potassium levels.

    'Klow': """The potassium value of your soil is low.
    <br/>Please consider the following suggestions:
    <br/><br/> • <i>Mix in muricate of potash or sulphate of potash</i> – these are great sources of potassium for your soil.
    <br/><br/> • <i>Try kelp meal or seaweed</i> – these organic materials are rich in potassium.
    <br/><br/> • <i>Use wood ash</i> – small amounts of wood ash can provide potassium, but use sparingly.
    <br/><br/> • <i>Add banana peels to compost</i> – banana peels are rich in potassium and make great compost material.
